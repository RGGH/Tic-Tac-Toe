# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python

Outlines -->

1 -> First we need to make the board using dictionary in which keys will be the location
     (i.e. : top-left, mid-right, etc.) and initially it's values will be empty space 
     and then after every move we will change the value according to player's choice of move.
     
2 -> Then we will have to print the updated board after every move in the game and thus we will make a function 
     in which we'll define the printBoard function so that we can easily print the board 
     everytime by calling this function.
     
3 -> Now we'll write the main function which has all the gameplay functionality.

4 -> Now we will check if player X or 0 has won, for every move after 5 moves.

5 -> If neither X nor 0 wins and the board is full, we'll declare the result as 'tie'.

6 -> Now we have to change the player after every move.

7 -> Now we'll ask if player wants to restart the game or not.
